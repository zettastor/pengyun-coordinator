Coordinator is responsible for managing a standard block storage device. As a server, the Coordinator responds to I/O requests submitted by client drivers, performs addressing, and then distributes the I/O requests to the corresponding [DataNode](https://github.com/zettastor/pengyun-datanode) processes on the storage node servers. It then returns the processing results to the client drivers.
